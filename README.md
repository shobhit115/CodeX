Features

- Member registration and authentication
- Event creation, listing, and registration management
- Team and role management for club organizers
- Admin dashboard (create/manage events, view registrations)

Project structure

- `Backend/` — Node.js (Express) backend with API routes, models, and services.
- `Frontend/` — React + Vite frontend for public pages and the member/admin portal.
- `Database/` — database-related scripts or snapshots (if present)
- `Testing/` — test-related helpers and test data

Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18
- npm or yarn
- Docker & Docker Compose (optional, but recommended for full-stack runs)
- MongoDB Atlas account (or use the provided local Docker MongoDB)
- Cloudinary account (for image uploads)

Quick start

### Method 1: Using Docker (Recommended)

The easiest way to run the entire stack (Frontend, Backend, and MongoDB) is with Docker Compose.

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/QuCodeXClub/CodeX.git
cd CodeX
```

2. Configure environment variables:
Copy `Backend/.env.sample` to `Backend/.env` and fill in your Cloudinary credentials (the `MONGODB_URI` will automatically be overridden by Docker).

3. Start the application:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
- Frontend will be at `http://localhost:5173`
- Backend API will be at `http://localhost:5000`
- MongoDB will run locally on port `27017`

---

### Method 2: Running Locally (Native npm)

1. **Backend Setup**:
```bash
cd Backend
cp .env.sample .env  # Fill in your MONGODB_URI and Cloudinary keys
npm install
npm run dev
```

2. **Frontend Setup**:
Open a new terminal:
```bash
cd Frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Development notes

- The Frontend uses Vite and serves on `5173`. The Backend runs via `nodemon` on `5000`.
- Environment variables: Must be set in `Backend/.env` (MongoDB, Cloudinary, CORS).
- For a more detailed backend setup, please refer to the [Backend Setup Guide](./Backend/SETUP_GUIDE.md).
